  Scenario Outline: Russian Doll 3 - Create customer request with dynamic header
    Given I have extracted russian doll base firstname
    And I use customer dynamic header for doll
    And I have the data to create Russian Doll with "<lastName>","<phone>","<address1>","<address2>"
    When I create post request to create russian doll one
    Then I get status code 201 from doll
    And response body Russian Doll one should contain
